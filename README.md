# DSE_Project
DSE Python project

current idea: a program that looks at a database of songs, their corresponding genres, a measure of popularity, and recommends songs based on the genre you input. 
so: 
choose a genre out of these
Here are some songs you may like: gives you 4 different songs from one genre. You can pick one and add it to the playlist; it's just a list.

Then: 
If you like this song you would probably like these other songs *shows you four songs* would you like to add any of these to your playlist?
would you like to keep looking for songs in this genre? you could make it so it was songs you wanted and you could search through the data.
would you like to look at other genres?
and so on.

ask if this works
find the data.
